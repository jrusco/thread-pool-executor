# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Thread Pool Executor

---

## 1. Overview

Design and implement a robust, efficient, and secure Thread Pool Executor in Java, suitable for backend systems built with the Spring Framework. The executor should manage a pool of reusable threads to execute submitted tasks, providing configurable concurrency, resource management, error handling, and extensibility. The implementation must adhere to modern software engineering principles and Java best practices.

---

## 2. Goals & Objectives

- **Efficient Task Execution:** Reuse a fixed or configurable number of threads to execute multiple tasks, minimizing thread creation overhead.
- **Concurrency Safety:** Ensure thread-safe operations and prevent race conditions, deadlocks, and resource leaks.
- **Configurable Behavior:** Allow customization of pool size, queue type, rejection policy, and shutdown behavior.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Handle exceptions gracefully, log errors, and ensure system stability.
- **Extensibility:** Design for easy integration with Spring and future enhancements (e.g., metrics, custom policies).
- **Observability:** Provide structured logging and hooks for monitoring task execution and pool health.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Core Features

- **Task Submission:**  
  - Support `Runnable` and `Callable<T>` tasks.
  - Return `Future<T>` for submitted `Callable` tasks.

- **Thread Pool Management:**  
  - Configurable core and maximum pool size.
  - Thread reuse for efficiency.
  - Option to set thread names and daemon status.

- **Task Queueing:**  
  - Use a thread-safe queue (e.g., `LinkedBlockingQueue`).
  - Configurable queue capacity.

- **Rejection Policies:**  
  - Support standard strategies: Abort, CallerRuns, Discard, DiscardOldest.
  - Allow custom rejection handlers.

- **Graceful Shutdown:**  
  - Support both graceful and immediate shutdown.
  - Ensure all running tasks complete or are interrupted as per shutdown mode.

- **Spring Integration:**  
  - Provide a Spring bean configuration for the executor.
  - Allow injection and lifecycle management via Spring.

### 3.2. Advanced Features

- **Exception Handling:**  
  - Catch and log uncaught exceptions from tasks.
  - Use structured logging for errors and warnings.
  - Allow custom exception handlers.

- **Thread Safety:**  
  - Use synchronization, locks, or concurrent collections as needed.
  - Avoid deadlocks and minimize contention.

- **Metrics & Monitoring:**  
  - Expose pool size, active thread count, queue size, completed task count.
  - Provide hooks for integration with Spring Actuator or custom monitoring.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**  
  - Minimize context switching and thread contention.
  - Ensure low latency for task submission and execution.

- **Reliability:**  
  - Handle resource exhaustion gracefully (e.g., full queue, max threads).
  - Ensure no memory or resource leaks.

- **Security:**  
  - Validate all user input and configuration.
  - Avoid use of `eval`, `exec`, or unsafe reflection.

- **Maintainability:**  
  - Code must be readable, modular, and well-documented.
  - Follow SOLID, DRY, and KISS principles.
  - Use meaningful variable and class names.

- **Testability:**  
  - Provide unit and integration tests for all core features and edge cases.
  - Ensure code is easy to mock and test in isolation.

---

## 5. Error Handling & Logging

- Use `try-catch-finally` blocks for all resource management.
- Catch and log all exceptions thrown by tasks.
- Use structured logging (e.g., SLF4J with MDC for context).
- Throw `IllegalArgumentException` for invalid configuration.
- Throw custom exceptions for pool lifecycle errors if needed.

---

## 6. Out of Scope

- Distributed thread pools (single JVM only).
- Task prioritization (FIFO queue only for v1).
- Dynamic scaling based on load (fixed or bounded pool for v1).
