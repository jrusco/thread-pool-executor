# Implementation Plan: Thread Pool Executor

---

## Milestone 1: Project Setup & Core Interfaces

- **1.1.** Initialize a new Java project with Gradle/Maven.
- **1.2.** Set up code style, static analysis, and logging dependencies (e.g., SLF4J).
- **1.3.** Define core interfaces:
    - `TaskExecutor` (submit, shutdown, etc.)
    - Custom exception classes for pool lifecycle and configuration errors.
- **1.4.** Write basic unit tests for interfaces and exceptions.

---

## Milestone 2: Basic Thread Pool & Task Submission

- **2.1.** Implement a basic thread pool:
    - Fixed-size worker thread pool.
    - Thread-safe task queue (e.g., `LinkedBlockingQueue`).
- **2.2.** Support `Runnable` and `Callable<T>` task submission.
    - Return `Future<T>` for `Callable<T>`.
- **2.3.** Implement graceful and immediate shutdown.
- **2.4.** Add structured logging for task submission, execution, and shutdown.
- **2.5.** Write unit tests for task submission, execution, and shutdown.

---

## Milestone 3: Configurability & Rejection Policies

- **3.1.** Add configuration options:
    - Core/max pool size, queue capacity, thread naming, daemon status.
    - Validate all configuration inputs.
- **3.2.** Implement standard rejection policies:
    - Abort, CallerRuns, Discard, DiscardOldest.
    - Allow custom rejection handlers.
- **3.3.** Write tests for configuration and rejection scenarios.

---

## Milestone 4: Error Handling & Observability

- **4.1.** Implement robust error handling:
    - Catch/log uncaught exceptions from tasks.
    - Allow custom exception handlers.
- **4.2.** Integrate structured logging (SLF4J with MDC).
- **4.3.** Expose metrics:
    - Pool size, active threads, queue size, completed tasks.
    - Provide hooks for monitoring integration.
- **4.4.** Add tests for error handling and metrics.

---

## Milestone 5: Spring Integration

- **5.1.** Provide Spring bean configuration for the executor.
- **5.2.** Support injection and lifecycle management via Spring.
- **5.3.** Document integration steps and provide sample configuration.
- **5.4.** Write integration tests with Spring context.

---

## Milestone 6: Documentation & Finalization

- **6.1.** Complete Javadoc and in-code documentation.
- **6.2.** Write a usage guide and troubleshooting section.
- **6.3.** Review code for SOLID, DRY, KISS, and security best practices.
- **6.4.** Conduct code review and address feedback.
- **6.5.** Run stress tests for concurrency/resource leaks.
- **6.6.** Finalize and tag MVP release.

**Note:** Each milestone should include code review, test coverage validation, and documentation updates before proceeding.
